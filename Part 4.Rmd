#Creating a saturated model for salary, including all variables:

#Rank - professor, associate professor, assistant professor
#Discipline - A = theoretical or B = applied
#Sex - male or female
#Years_PhD - years since getting PhD
#Years_Service - years as a faculty member

sal_lm1 <- lm(Salary ~ Rank + Discipline + Sex + Years_PhD + Years_Service, data = faculty_salaries)

summary(sal_lm1)

#Info from the model summary:
#For rank, the referene level is associate professor
#For sex, the reference level is female
#For discipline, the reference level is A (theoretical)
#Years_PhD and Years_Service are continuous 

#Coefficients for rank seem to make sense - compared to associate professor, a full professor makes a good deal more, and an assistant professor makes less (matches the means that were calculated above)

#Coefficient for sex seems to make sense - male faculty made more

#Coefficient for discipline seems to make sense - applied made more than theoretical

#Are years_PhD and years_service redundant? Do they sort of get at a similar thing? Which one is better?

#Based on overall p-value, the model does significantly predict salary (p < 0.001)
